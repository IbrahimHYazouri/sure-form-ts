## üîç Features

- Simple and fluent API for rule definitions
- Built-in validation rules (required, minLength, email, etc.)
- Custom rule support
- Supports sync and async validations
- Works seamlessly with plain JavaScript or Vue.js
- Easily extendable and testable

## ‚úÖ Available Rules

### 1. `required`
Checks if the value is present (not `null`, `undefined`, or empty string).

```ts
{ name: ["required"] }
```

---

### 2. `string`
Ensures the value is a string.

```ts
{ username: ["required", "string"] }
```

---

### 3. `numeric`
Ensures the value is a number.

```ts
{ age: ["required", "numeric"] }
```

---

### 4. `boolean`
Ensures the value is a boolean (`true` or `false`).

```ts
{ isActive: ["required", "boolean"] }
```

---

### 5. `array`
Ensures the value is an array.

```ts
{ tags: ["required", "array"] }
```

---

### 6. `email`
Validates that the value is a valid email address.

```ts
{ email: ["required", "email"] }
```

---

### 7. `url`
Validates that the value is a valid URL.

```ts
{ website: ["url"] }
```

---

### 8. `min:value`
For strings, arrays, and numbers: enforces minimum length or value.

```ts
{ password: ["required", "min:6"] }
{ age: ["numeric", "min:18"] }
```

---

### 9. `max:value`
For strings, arrays, and numbers: enforces maximum length or value.

```ts
{ username: ["required", "max:15"] }
{ quantity: ["numeric", "max:100"] }
```

---

### 10. `between:min,max`
Checks if a number or string length falls between two values (inclusive).

```ts
{ age: ["required", "between:18,60"] }
{ password: ["between:6,12"] }
```

---

## üîç Notes

- Each rule can accept arguments using `:` and `,` delimiters.
- Arguments are automatically parsed and passed to rule methods.
